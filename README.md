# 10ser, a barebones DL library

ml from scratch in nearly pure python

TODO:

- make typesafe with errors
- implement training
- implement backpropogation
- implement a network method to save the weight and bias state
 - array of arrays of weights with last element bias? first elem bias?
 - another method should load weights and biases

Thinking my representation isnt great, might have to redo that.
Better to represent the weights and biases in the network as a single set of
arrays rather than store them in layer objects?
